    """Badge reader hardware abstraction.

    A Wiegand GPIO badge reader is defined in config as:

      [pins]
      name = WiegandGPIOReader:7:13

    where 7 is the D0 pin (physical numbering), and 13 is the D1 pin (also
    physical numbering).  In this configuration the 6 pin J5 connector will be
    structured as follows:
        Pin 1: D0
        Pin 2: D1
        Pin 3: No connection
        Pin 4: Ground
        Pin 5: 12v
        Pin 6: No connection

    Pin 6 is used for the switched +12v provided by the ULN2003AD chip
    (L5_LOGIC).  As we want to constantly power the RFID reader, there is no need
    to populate Pin 6.

    It should also be noted that most GPIO based RFID badge readers operate at 5v
    logic, so one should use care when connecting them to the host.  Most readers
    communicate only from the reader to the host.  If this is the case a simple
    voltage divider is sufficient to protect the GPIO pins on the host, in the
    event that two way communication is needed a level shifter should be used.
